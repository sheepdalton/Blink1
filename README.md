## Introduction

Isovists are areas visible from a specific point in space, and overlapping isovists provide valuable insights into how different points in an urban environment relate to one another. This software enables users to compute and analyze overlapping isovists, supporting urban planners and researchers in making informed decisions about urban design and development.

## Features

- Compute isovists from multiple points in an urban environment
- Analyze overlapping isovists to understand spatial relationships
- Visualize isovist overlaps using various graphical representations
- Export analysis results for further use and study

## Installation

To install the Urban Analysis Software, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/urban-analysis-software.git
    ```

2. Open the project in the Processing IDE:
    - Launch the Processing IDE.
    - Open the `urban-analysis-software` folder.

3. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
    - If the project uses any external libraries, download and add them through the Processing IDE.

## Usage

# Operation Instructions

- **`o`**: Open an SVG file
- **`k`**: Set the number of isovists
- **`g`**: Generate a grid of isovists
- **`r`**: Generate random isovists (better for fewer isovists)

- **`a`**: Process isovists to compute integration and fractional integration (can take time)

- **`1`** .... **`0`**: Switch between values
- **`t`**: Save table of isovists and data

- **Click and drag**: Move
- **Scroll wheel**: Zoom
- **Control key + Click**: Add an isovist at the selected point

- **`z`**: Hide down isovists

- **Click**
  - **`d`**: Fractional depth from nearest isovist
  - **`D`**: Step depth from nearest selected isovist
